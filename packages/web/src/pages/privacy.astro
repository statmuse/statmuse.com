      <p><strong>STATMUSE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p><strong>(Last Updated April 28, 2023)</strong></p>
      <p>
        StatMuse, Inc. (www.statmuse.com), as well as any present or future
        affiliated or related company (“StatMuse” or “we”), recognizes the
        importance of your privacy. This privacy policy tells you what personal
        information we collect and how we use it. StatMuse may change this
        privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, as discussed
        in section 7 below. By using or visiting any StatMuse website,
        application, product, software, tool, data feed, and/or service
        (collectively the "Service"), you understand and agree to the terms of
        this policy. Please read this policy carefully.
      </p>
      <p><strong>1. What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
      <p>
        a.<em>Information You Provide To Us</em>: We may collect personally
        identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it
        to us, for example when you contact us and provide personal information
        such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, or other information.
        Where applicable, personally identifiable information includes “personal
        data” as defined by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. <em>Information We Receive From Your Use Of Our Services</em>: We may
        collect and aggregate certain information derived from your use of our
        Services. This information may include information such as a website
        that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language,
        hardware types, geographic location, access times and durations, queries
        submitted to the Service (including text translation of any audio
        queries). We also may collect navigational information, including
        information about the Service content you access or are served in
        response to your written or audio request, or pages you view, the links
        you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Service. We
        also collect information about your activity in our Services, which we
        use to do things like generate content or improve our models. The
        activity information we collect may include search history and
        interactions with the Service. We use this information to analyze usage
        patterns as part of making improvements to the Service. All information
        we collect may be used as training data in our own AI datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. <em>Third Parties</em>: This Privacy Policy does not apply to the
        privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control,
        including but not limited to any third party voice assistants, websites,
        services, applications, online resources to which the Service may link
        to, be accessed from, or otherwise reference (collectively “Third Party
        Services” or “TPS”). We encourage you to carefully review the privacy
        policies of any TPS you access.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have the option to register or access the Service using a TPS.
        By authorizing us to access your TPS account, you authorize us to obtain
        certain information from your TPS account, which may include your name,
        email address, associated IP addresses or other available information.
        We only obtain information from your TPS account that you specifically
        authorize and grant us permission to obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
        StatMuse does not consider personally identifiable information to
        include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a
        third party to identify a specific individual. We collect and use your
        personally-identifiable information to: provide the Service; operate and
        improve our Service; provide customer service; perform research and
        analysis aimed at improving our products, Service and technology; and
        display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may always choose not to provide personally identifiable
        information, but if you so choose, certain parts of the Service may not
        be available to you. If you have registered an account with us, you will
        have agreed to provide your personally identifiable information in order
        to access the Service. This consent provides us with the legal basis we
        require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the
        right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our
        use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use
        our Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service may be accessed through mobile phones, websites, and audio
        TSP (such as personal assistant or Artificial Intelligence apps) which
        have their own terms of use and privacy policies, particularly regarding
        the handling of audio content submitted by a user. We encourage you to
        review such terms and policies as they may apply to your use of the
        Service. We have no responsibility for the terms and policies of any
        hardware, software, application, or TSP.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not collect sensitive personal data and we ask that you not send
        us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social
        security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin,
        political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or
        genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership)
        on or through the Service or otherwise to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you
        submit content to the Service, you consent to our processing and use of
        such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do
        not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data,
        you must not submit such content to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. <em>Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage</em>: We may collect
        information using “cookies”, which are small data files stored on the
        hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use
        both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
        persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until
        you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
        experience when using the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served
        directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by
        us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits any site
        or application that is party of the Service; and (2) third party
        cookies, which are served by service providers on sites or applications
        and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or
        mobile device when it visits other websites.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies we use</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Service uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out
        below:
      </p>
      <table>
        <colgroup>
          <col style="width: 13%" />

          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr class="odd">
            <td><em>Essential Cookies</em></td>
            <td>
              These cookies are essential to provide you with services available
              through the Service and to enable you to use some of its features.
              For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites
              or applications and help the content of the pages you request load
              quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked
              for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide
              you with those services.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="even">
            <td><em>Functionality Cookies</em></td>
            <td>
              These cookies allow the Service to remember choices you make when
              you use a site or application, such as remembering your language
              preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the
              changes you make to other parts of your account, or preferences.
              The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more
              personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your
              preferences every time you use the Service.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="odd">
            <td><em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em></td>
            <td>
              <p>
                These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to
                the Service and how users use the Service. The information
                gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The
                information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number
                of visitors to, the websites that referred them, the pages
                visited, what time of day they visited, whether they have
                visited before, and other similar information. We use this
                information to help operate the Service more efficiently, to
                gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of
                activity on our Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses
                its own cookies. It is only used to improve how the Service
                work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics
                cookies here: <a

              </p>
              <p>
                You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use
                of the Service by downloading and installing the browser plugin
                available via this link: <a

              content on or through a social networking website such as
              Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that
              you have done this.

      <p><strong>Disabling cookies</strong></p>
      <p>
        You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In
        order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser
        (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit”
        facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your
        settings. If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some
        inconvenience in your use of the Service. For example, we may not be
        able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log
        in every time you use the Service.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Pixel Tags</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and
        clear GIFs) on the Service to track the actions of users on our sites
        and applications. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of
        your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded
        invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing
        campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Service, so that we
        can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect
        using pixel tags is not linked to our users' personal data.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Flash Technology</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may also use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local
        Shared Object (“LSOs”)) on our Service to collect and store information
        about your use of the Service. Unlike other cookies, Flash cookies
        cannot be removed or rejected via your browser settings. If you do not
        want Flash cookies stored on your computer or mobile device, you can
        adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage
        using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel at <a
          href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"

            https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html

        </a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage
        Settings Panel at <a
          href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"

          </u>
        </a> and following the instructions. Please note that setting the Flash
        Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or
        impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including,
        potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Service.

        <strong>2. What Do We Do With The Information That We Collect?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, StatMuse does not sell or
        share your personal information with any outside parties.
      </p>
      <p>a. StatMuse will use your information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>to operate, maintain, and improve the Service;</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>

            your account;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            to operate and administer any promotions you participate in on any
            site or application;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            to respond to your comments and questions and to provide customer
            service;

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            to send information including technical notices, updates, security

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            with your consent, to send you marketing e-mails about upcoming
            promotions, and other news, including information about products and
            services offered by us and our affiliates. You may opt-out of
            receiving such information at any time: such marketing emails tell
            you how to “opt-out.” Please note, even if you opt out of receiving
            marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails.
            Non-marketing emails include emails about your account with us (if
            you have one) and our business dealings with you;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>to process payments you make via the Service; and</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            as we believe necessary or appropriate (a) to comply with applicable
            laws; (b) to comply with lawful requests and legal process,
            including to respond to requests from public and government
            authorities; (c) to enforce our Policy; and (d) to protect our
            rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>as training data for our own AI datasets.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may share this information with service providers who perform
        services on our behalf, or other services like processing information
        requests, displaying stored data you access, to assist us in marketing,
        to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only
        the personal information they need to provide the service they provide,
        will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and
        will be prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use information you provide to better serve you, and, if you
        have given your consent for us to do so, to send you email or text
        messages concerning offers from our partners and other third parties
        that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive
        marketing emails, you may adjust your “Personal Information Preferences”
        as described below or follow the “unsubscribe” or “stop” instructions
        included within each communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only retain your personally identifiable information as long as
        reasonably required to provide you with the Service unless a longer
        retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, for
        regulatory purposes).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may contact us anytime to opt-out of: (i) direct marketing
        communications; (ii) our collection of sensitive personal data; (iii)
        any new processing of your personal data that we may carry out beyond
        the original purpose; or (iv) the transfer of your personal data outside
        the European Economic Area. Please note that your use of some of the
        Service may be ineffective upon opt-out. You may also: (A) access the
        data we hold about you at any time via your account or by contacting us
        directly; (B) update or correct any inaccuracies in your personal data
        by contacting us; (C) move your data to other service provider; (D) in
        certain situations, for example when the data we hold about you is no
        longer relevant or is incorrect, you can request that we erase your
        data. You may contact us at support@statmuse.com anytime for any other
        questions you may have about your personally identifiable information
        and our use of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. <em>Disclosure</em>: As a general rule, StatMuse will not disclose
        any of your personally identifiable information except under one of the
        following circumstances: we have your permission, including the
        permission granted by your acceptance of this Privacy Policy; we
        determine in good faith that it is legally required to be revealed by
        any relevant statute, regulation, ordinance, rule, administrative or
        court order, decree, or subpoena; it is information that we determine
        must be disclosed to correct what we believe to be false or misleading
        information or to address activities that we believe to be manipulative,
        deceptive or otherwise a violation of law; where you are otherwise
        notified at the time we collect the data; where we need to share your
        information to provide the product or service you have requested; when
        such disclosure is made subject to confidentiality restrictions in
        connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition
        (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the

        per 12-month period at no cost to you. For subsequent requests, we may
        charge a fee if we determine that the request is excessive, repetitive,
        or manifestly unfounded, but will not do so without providing you with a
        cost estimate before processing your request.

        We respond to and process requests promptly and within the timeframes
        required by the CCPA/CPRA. Please note that all requests are subject to
        proper prior verification before processing, as required by the
        CCPA/CPRA. If you are the authorized agent of an individual making a
        request, you may have to take additional steps to verify your identity
        and demonstrate that you can exercise the individual’s rights on their
        behalf.

      <p><strong>7. Security and Encryption</strong></p>
      <p>
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your
        personal information. No method of transmission over the internet,
        mobile technology, or method of electronic storage, is completely
        secure. Therefore, while we endeavor to maintain physical, electronic,
        and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the
        information that we collect online, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security. Our Service has security measures in place designed to protect
        against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our
        control. We use standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that
        encodes information for such transmissions. All Service information is
        maintained on secure servers. Access to stored data is protected by
        multi-layered security controls including firewalls, role-based access
        controls and passwords. You are responsible to keep your password
        secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is
        no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any
        account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately
        notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@statmuse.com.
      </p>
      <p><strong>8. Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any
        time. When we make changes, we will revise the “last updated” date at
        the top of the policy. If there are material changes to this statement
        or in how we will use your personal information, we will notify you by
        prominently posting a notice of such changes here or on our home page,
        or by sending you an email. We encourage you to review this policy
        whenever you visit one of our websites or applications.
