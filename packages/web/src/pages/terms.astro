        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, STATMUSE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
        EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
        PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS OR OTHER INTANGIBLE
        LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, FROM THE USE
        OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,
        CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER
        LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT REVFLUENCE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
        POSSBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS
        FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
        GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT STATMUSE
        WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY CONTENT OR
        INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES. THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS WILL
        APPLY TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
      </p>
      <p>5. TERMINATION</p>
      <p>
        5.1 Termination.  StatMuse may terminate Your account and access/use of
        the Service immediately if You breach any provision of these Terms.
        StatMuse, in its sole discretion, also has the right to suspend or
        terminate Your account and refuse any and all current or future use of
        the Service, or any other StatMuse service, for any reason at any time.
        Such termination for convenience of the Service will result in the
        deactivation, deletion or denial of access to Your account. StatMuse
        reserves the right to refuse to provide the Service to anyone for any
        reason at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2. Effect of Termination.  Upon any termination or cancellation of
        Your account, You will promptly (i) cease using the Service; and (ii)
        cease using and will expunge any StatMuse Content and Third Party
        Content on Your systems obtained from the Service as may be required by
        StatMuse. Upon request by StatMuse, You will certify in writing that You
        have complied with Section 5.2(ii).
      </p>
      <p>
        5.3. Survival.  The rights and obligations of the parties contained in
        Sections 1.7, 2.4, 3, 4, 5.2, 5.3 and 6 will survive the termination or
        cancellation of Your account and access to the Service under these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <p>6. GENERAL</p>
      <p>
        6.1. No Assignment.  You may not assign any rights and obligations under
        these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
        without StatMuse's express prior written consent. Any attempt to do so
        without such consent will be null and of no effect. StatMuse may assign
        this Agreement provided any assignee fulfills the StatMuse obligations
        set forth in these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2. Governing Law.  You agree that (i) the Service shall be deemed
        solely based in Nevada, and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive
        website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over StatMuse,
        either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Nevada. These
        Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of
        Nevada, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. You and we
        agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state or federal court
        located in Reno, Nevada for any actions for which the parties retain the
        right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
        competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
        secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in
        the Dispute Resolution Provision below.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
        THE SERVICES OR CONTENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE
        CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY
        BARRED AND WAIVED.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3. Severability, Waiver.  If for any reason a court of competent
        jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or
        unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
        permissible and the other provisions will remain in full force and
        effect. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by
        either party of any of its remedies hereunder will be without prejudice
        to its other remedies under these Terms. The failure by either party to
        enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of
        future enforcement of that or any other provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.4. Notices.  All notices required or permitted under these Terms of
        Service will be in writing and delivered by courier or overnight
        delivery services, by electronic mail, or by certified mail, and in each
        instance will be deemed given upon receipt. All communications will be
        sent to the addresses on file related to Your account or to such other
        address as may be specified by either party to the other. Either party
        may change its address for notices under this agreement by giving
        written notice to the other party.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.5. Force Majeure.  StatMuse is not be responsible for any failure or
        delay in its performance under these Terms due to causes beyond its
        reasonable control, including, but not limited to, labor disputes,
        strikes, lockouts, shortages of or inability to obtain labor, energy,
        raw materials or supplies, war, terrorism, riot, acts of God or
        governmental action.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.6. Export Control.  You agree to comply fully with all applicable
        export laws and regulations of the United States ("Export Laws") to
        ensure that the Service or any data or information from the Service is:
        (i) exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of
        Export Laws; or (ii) used for any purposes prohibited by the Export
        Laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.7. Relationship.  These Terms do not establish any relationship
        between the parties of partnership, joint venture, employment,
        franchise, or agency. Neither party will have the power to bind the
        other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's
        prior written consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.8. Entire Agreement.  These Terms, together with any other StatMuse
        terms, conditions and policies, constitute the complete and exclusive
        understanding and agreement between You and StatMuse and supersedes all
        prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral,
        relating to its subject matter. Any waiver, modification or amendment of
        any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and
        signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties.
      </p>
      <p>6.9.  Dispute Resolution Provision</p>
      <p>
        You and StatMuse agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
        out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
        enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the
        Service (collectively “Disputes”) will be resolved according to the
        provision of this section
      </p>
      <p>
        (a)  Informal Resolution.  We will first try to resolve any Dispute
        informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding
        (except for Disputes described in Section 10.4 below) for at least 30
        days after one of us notifies the other of a Dispute in writing. Notice
        of the Dispute will include a brief written statement that sets forth
        the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the
        facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested. You will
        send your notice by email to support@statmuse.com AND to 5348 Vegas
        Drive, #246, Las Vegas, NV 89108.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        (b)  Formal Resolution.   If the Dispute is not resolved informally, we
        agree that it will be resolved by binding arbitration and not in courts
        of general jurisdiction ; except that each party retains the right to
        seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
        jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
        secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that you and StatMuse are each waiving the
        right to a trial by jury  or to participate as a plaintiff or class
        member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
        Further, unless both you and StatMuse otherwise agree in writing, the
        arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may
        not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
        proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the
        entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.
        Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution”
        section will survive any termination of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        (i)  Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.  The arbitration will be
        administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
        accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
        Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in
        effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The
        AAA Rules are available at  www.adr.org/  or by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
        interpretation and enforcement of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        (ii)  Arbitration Process.  A party who desires to initiate arbitration
        must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
        specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for
        Arbitration at  www.adr.org/  and a separate form for California
        residents at www.adr.org/ .) The arbitrator will be either a retired
        judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Nevada and
        will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer
        dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
        arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for
        Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with
        the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        (iii)  Arbitration Location and Procedure.  Unless you and StatMuse
        otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where
        you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration
        will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and StatMuse
        submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
        determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000,
        your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to
        the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a
        reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
        expedited nature of the arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        (iv)  Arbitrator’s Decision.  The arbitrator will render an award within
        the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision
        will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
        arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be
        entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award
        damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of
        Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for
        which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory
        or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the
        extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
        individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to
        an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under
        applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        (v)  Fees.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative
        and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
        However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, StatMuse
        will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the
        substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for
        Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as
        measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
        11(b)).
      </p>
      <p>
        (vi)  No Class Action . YOU AND STATMUSE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
        CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT
        AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
        PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the
        arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may
        not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
        proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        (vii)  Changes.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification”
        section above, if StatMuse amends this “Dispute Resolution” section
        after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any
        subsequent changes to these Terms), you will be notified in accordance
        with these Terms. You may reject any such change by sending us written
        notice (including by email to support@statmuse.com) within 30 days of
        the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated
        Date” above or in the date of StatMuse’s email to you notifying you of
        such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
        arbitrate any Dispute between you and StatMuse in accordance with the
        provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first
        accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
        Terms).
      </p>
      <p>
        (viii)  Enforceability.  If the “No Class Action” section of this
        Dispute Resolution Provision is found to be unenforceable, or if the
        entire Dispute Resolution Provision is found to be unenforceable, then
        the entirety of the Dispute Resolution Provision will be null and void
        and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and
        venue described above will govern any action arising out of or related
        to these Terms.
      </p>
